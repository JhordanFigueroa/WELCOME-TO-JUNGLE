# WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE

# Introduction 
ALOHA, Welcome to WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE! The jungle is a dangerous place. Eat kittens to survive! 

# Concept 
The player has to navigate the tiger with the up/down/right/left arrow keys to eat a kitten. Once the tiger eats the kitten, a new kitten appears and you have to eat the kitten. The highest score wins, eat as many kittens! The game is lost if the player collides with any part of the box that confides the game. The tiger begins at a set location within the game board; the center for each level. The kitten begins at a random position each time the game is started. At any time the player can start at the level they want to start.
